### OOP_for_DataScience Assignment

1. Create a class called ErrorCalculator that has methods to compute the residuals, standardised residuals, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Name these methods get_residuals, get_standardised_residuals, get_mse and get_rmse respectively. You can also have a method, error_summary that prints the average, minimum and maximum of the standardised residuals, as well as the MSE and RMSE.

1. Create a generic class called Plotter. This class should have a method, run_calculations, to calculate the residuals if they have not yet been calculated, and a method plot, which simply plots a histogram of the residuals.
